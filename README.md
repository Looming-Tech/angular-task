# Calendar View

The goal of the application is to have a calendar view to display users meetings.
A meeting consists of: 
- start time
- end time
- name
- meeting room. 

The view must visualize one month with all days per screen. Navigation through all months is desired (but optional). You should not use any of the existing calendar API's.
Each day must be represented by a cell large enough to contain at least 3 of the meetings for that day. When a cell is selected all the meetings should be displayed in a pop-up window. All meetings should be arranged by their starting time.
Two meetings can't be placed in the same room at the same time.

Please focus on the visuals, it is important to be responsive without the use of **Bootstrap** to demonstrate **CSS** skills
Task must be done using either: **Angular IO** or **React** coding on **ES6** or **TypeScript** upon developer's preference.

The implementation we ask you to create should not have any backend component data must be loaded from the link below:
